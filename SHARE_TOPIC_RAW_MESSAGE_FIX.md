# Share Topic Raw Message Display Fix

## Issue
The `share/topic` was not showing raw message content in the TopicManager UI. Instead, it was showing "new file" notifications or error messages even for simple text messages.

## Root Cause
The problem was in the message processing flow for the `share/topic`:

1. **Message received** on `share/topic` → ✅ Correctly forwarded to TopicManager
2. **File share handler** also processes every message → ❌ **Problem**: Treats every message as a file notification

### Previous Problematic Flow:
```
Text message sent to share/topic: "Hello!"
        ↓
_processIncomingMessage() called
        ↓ 
TopicManager.addMessage() ← Raw message added correctly
        ↓
_handleFileShareMessage() ← Also called for ALL messages
        ↓
jsonDecode("Hello!") ← Fails to parse as JSON
        ↓
catch (e) { 
  _logger.log('❌ Error processing file notification: $e') ← Error logged
}
```

The issue was that `_handleFileShareMessage` was trying to parse **every message** on `share/topic` as a JSON file notification, even simple text messages.

## Fix Applied
Updated the `_handleFileShareMessage` method to:

1. **Gracefully handle text messages** - Don't log errors for non-JSON content
2. **Only process actual file notifications** - Messages with `type: 'file_notification'`
3. **Let regular text messages pass through** - They're already handled by TopicManager

### After Fix Flow:
```
Text message sent to share/topic: "Hello!"
        ↓
_processIncomingMessage() called
        ↓ 
TopicManager.addMessage() ← Raw message added correctly ✅
        ↓
_handleFileShareMessage() ← Also called
        ↓
jsonDecode("Hello!") ← Fails to parse as JSON
        ↓
catch (e) { 
  _logger.log('💬 Text message on share topic: "Hello!"') ← No error, just info
}
        ↓
UI shows: "Hello!" in TopicManager ✅
```

### Code Changes:

**File: `lib/services/mqtt_service.dart`**

```dart
// BEFORE (problematic):
} catch (e) {
  _logger.log('❌ Error processing file notification: $e');
}

// AFTER (fixed):
} catch (e) {
  // This is likely a regular text message, not JSON - this is normal
  _logger.log('💬 Text message on share topic: "$message"');
  // No error logging needed - regular text messages are expected
}
```

## Result
Now the `share/topic` behaves correctly for both use cases:

### ✅ **Regular Text Messages**
- **Sent**: `"Hello from device!"`
- **UI Display**: Raw text `"Hello from device!"` appears in TopicManager
- **Logs**: `💬 Text message on share topic: "Hello from device!"`
- **No errors or unwanted notifications**

### ✅ **File Notifications** 
- **Sent**: `{"type": "file_notification", "server_url": "..."}`
- **UI Display**: Raw JSON appears in TopicManager
- **File Processing**: Also triggers file download logic
- **Logs**: `📁 File notification detected, processing...`

## Benefits
1. **Raw message display**: All messages on `share/topic` now appear exactly as sent
2. **No false errors**: Text messages don't generate error logs
3. **Dual functionality**: Still supports file sharing when proper JSON is sent
4. **Consistent behavior**: Matches the behavior of other topics like `test/topic`

## Testing
- ✅ Send text message to `share/topic` → Shows raw text in UI
- ✅ Send file notification JSON to `share/topic` → Shows raw JSON in UI + triggers file download
- ✅ No compilation errors
- ✅ No false error messages in logs
