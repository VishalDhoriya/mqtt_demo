# Fix: Message Duplication Issue & Payload Size Problem

## Problem Identified
1. Messages were appearing **twice** on the sending device but only **once** on receiving devices
2. **NEW**: Payload size error causing messages to fail: `Invalid value: Not in inclusive range 4..139: 260`

## Root Causes

### 1. Message Duplication
The duplication was caused by adding messages to TopicManager in **two places**:
- **When sending** a message (`publishMessage` method)
- **When receiving** the message back from the broker (`_handleIncomingMessage` method)

### 2. Payload Size Issue
The structured JSON messages were too large for the MQTT broker:
```json
{
  "content": "message",
  "senderId": "local_device", 
  "senderName": "Android motorola edge 40",
  "timestamp": "2025-07-10T..."
}
```
This created payloads of ~260 bytes, but the broker expected 4-139 bytes.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Removed Duplicate Addition
- **Removed** message addition from `publishMessage` method
- **Only** add messages when they are received via `_handleIncomingMessage`

### 2. Simplified Message Format
- **Reverted** to simple text messages to avoid payload size limits
- **Removed** structured JSON payloads that were causing broker errors
- **Simplified** sender identification logic

### 3. Fixed Message Flow
```
Send simple text message → MQTT Broker → Receive back → Add to TopicManager once
```

## Files Modified
- `lib/services/mqtt_service.dart` - Fixed duplicate addition and payload size
- `DUPLICATE_MESSAGE_FIX.md` - Updated documentation

## Result
✅ **Messages publish successfully** without payload errors
✅ **Single message display** on all devices  
✅ **No more broker crashes** due to payload size
✅ **Consistent behavior** between sender and receivers
✅ **Real-time updates** maintained

## Testing Verification
1. Send a message from Device A
2. ✅ Message publishes successfully (no payload errors)
3. ✅ Message appears **once** on Device A
4. ✅ Message appears **once** on Device B
5. ✅ Both devices show the same message count
6. ✅ No broker crashes or range errors

The fix prioritizes reliability over advanced sender identification, ensuring messages work consistently across all devices without hitting MQTT payload limits.
